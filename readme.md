This project is for unit testing for performance between JDBC, Persism and JPA/hibernate.

I'm using the database from StackOverflow (2010 version) which should large enough to get good numbers.

If anyone wants to give this a run attach the StackOverflow database
and modify the```datasource.properties``` file. 

Stay tuned!
